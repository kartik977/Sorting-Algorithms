-------PROJECT 1(SORTING ALGORITHMS)-------- Implement and compare the following sorting algorithm:

Merge sort
Heap sort
Quick sort (Regular quick sort* and quick sort using 3 medians)
Insertion sort
Selection sort
Bubble sort
-------------------MOTIVATION----------------

To implement various sorting algorithms, calculate their run time for different data sizes, compare their run time and conclude best sorting algorithm.

-------------------FILES--------------------


1)outline.html :-
It is the html file for the output of the code on the web. This is the main file which will show the output of the whole program.

2)generate.js :-
This file handles the random inputs we generate and is like the interface between html file and the main sorting file which we have made. Also contains the function for the comparisons of all algorithms.

3)sorts.js :-
This is the file in which we use all the sorting algorithms.

4)home.css :-
It is a css file which is only used to wrap the content of the input and output in html file.

------------------TECHNOLOGIES USED----------
Javascript Version : ES-2015
HTML : HTML-5
